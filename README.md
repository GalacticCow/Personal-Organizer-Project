# Personal-Organizer-Project
A collaboration for Web Programming 2 class with Riley Manifold
This is a test edit to see if I can commit to the repository.
Beware friendly flowers.

Riley:  For CSS:
    -Format generated item list correctly using CSS
    -Generate an expanded list (not only one line, no overflow hiding) when it also has the class "ex".
     This will be triggered when the user hovers over (maybe clicks, wait and see) an item.
